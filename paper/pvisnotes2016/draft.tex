Streamline-based techniques play an important role in visualizing and analyzing uncertain steady vector fields. It is a challenging problem to generate accurate streamlines in uncertain vector fields due to the global uncertainty transportation. In this work, we present a novel probabilistic method for streamline computation on uncertain steady vector fields using a Bayesian framework. In our framework, a streamline is modeled as a state space model which captures the spatial coherence of integration steps and uncertainty in local distributions using the conditional prior density and the likelihood function. To approximate the posterior distribution for all the possible traces originating from a given seed position, a set of weighted samples are iteratively updated from which streamlines with higher likelihood can be derived. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare our method with alternative methods on different types of flow field data sets. Our method can generate possible streamlines with higher certainty and hence more accurate flow traces.

\maketitle

Uncertainty is introduced in scientific data sets from various sources. As the computation power and storage capacity of modern computers continue to grow, simulations can now produce data at very high spatial and temporal resolutions, which makes it necessary to choose a representation for analysis at a reduced size. Several data reduction techniques have been introduced to solve big data problems~\cite{6378985, 7156380, conf/ldav/LiuLBP12, DBLP:conf/ldav/ThompsonLBBGPP11}, which inevitably introduce uncertainty into the resulting data. And more recently, ensembles of simulations and stochastic simulations are becoming increasingly popular, which produce data with uncertainty in nature. Further more, uncertainty may also come from errors produced by numerical simulations or instrument measurements. Hence, analyzing and visualizing uncertainty is becoming increasingly indispensable to the understanding of scientific data.

In many scientific and engineering disciplines, analysis and visualization of vector fields continue to play an important role. To date, various techniques have been developed, among which streamline based techniques play a key role in steady vector fields exploration. Although a variety of methods have been introduced to analyze and visualize uncertain vector fields, the streamline computation for uncertain vector fields is still a challenging problem. Generating streamlines that have a higher likelihood to occur in an uncertain vector field is non-trivial because the uncertainty is propagated and accumulated along the streamlines. Previously, researchers have used the Monte Carlo approach to integrate probabilistic particle traces, such as the work presented by Otto et al.~\cite{Otto10a, Otto11a}. Although the Monte Carlo method is easy to understand and implement, it suffers from several drawbacks. First, it is sensitive to local uncertainties in vector fields. When a particle passes through a highly uncertain region, the results of the trajectory estimation can be poor. Second, the spatial coherence of vector directions was not considered. As a result, the particles can change their directions abruptly along their trajectories.

In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian approach for probabilistic particle tracing. Our approach is inspired by the following observations: Since physical phenomena often have a continuous nature, vector directions in a flow field are typically correlated in the spatial domain. Hence, the correlation between vector directions along a streamline, which is generated from such steady vector fields, should be considered. In order to take advantage of these observations, we formulate the probabilistic particle tracing problem by a state space hidden Markov model. We model the probability that a particle will encounter from one vector direction to the next as the prior density to characterize the correlation between vector directions of adjacent integration steps, and use the observation density from the data to characterize the uncertainty of local vector directions. Based on the Bayesian model, we compute the posterior distribution of streamlines to estimate the trajectories that are more likely for a particle to follow from a given seed position. Since it is unlikely that the prior or observation densities derived from real world data sets are Gaussian, we make use of the particle filtering~\cite{doucet2001sequential} technique in this work. In the end, we render the estimated uncertain streamline bundles and search for the most likely trajectory within. Through experiments on different types of vector fields, the proposed method produces streamline bundles of higher likelihood and hence more accurate paths.
