\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we present a novel approach for streamline estimation on uncertain steady vector fields. We model the particle tracing problem using a Bayesian framework and solve it using particle filtering iteratively estimating the posterior density function. Unlike the previous methods, our approach exploits the correlation between vector directions of adjacent integration steps as well as local vector direction distributions by modeling the prior and the observation density. This solution has been tested on a number of flow field data sets. Compared to the previous methods, our method gives more concentrated traces, and can produce paths of high probability closer to the ground truth.

There are several directions for future research. We will extend our framework to handle time-varying vector datasets, where the specific characteristics of pathlines and streaklines will be taken into account. Secondly, extensions to other flow visualization techniques like FTLE or LIC will be studied.
