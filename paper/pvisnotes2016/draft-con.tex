\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we present a novel approach for streamline estimation on uncertain steady vector fields. We model the particle tracing problem using a Bayesian framework and solve it using particle filtering. This solution has been tested on two flow field data sets. Compared to the previous methods, our method gives more concentrated traces, and can produce paths of high probability closer to the ground truth in similar computation times. There are several directions for future research. We will extend our framework to handle time-varying vector datasets, where the specific characteristics of pathlines and streaklines will be taken into account. Secondly, extensions to other flow visualization techniques like FTLE or LIC will be studied.
