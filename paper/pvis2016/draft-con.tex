\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we present a novel approach for streamline estimation on distribution-based steady vector fields. We model the particle tracing problem using a state space framework and solve it using particle filtering iteratively estimating the posterior density function. Unlike the previous methods, our approach exploits the smoothness of streamlines as well as local vector direction distributions by modeling the prior and the observation density. This solution has been tested on a number of flow field data sets. Compared to the previous methods, our method gives more concentrated traces, and can produce paths of high probability closer to the ground truth.

There are several directions for future research. We will extend our framework to handle time-varying vector datasets, where the specific characteristics of pathlines, streaklines, and streamlines will be taken into account. Secondly, extensions to other flow visualization techniques like FTLE or LIC will be studied. Thirdly, due to large uncertainties in some local distributions, there is still room to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. One possibility is to use the Resample-Move algorithm in the particle filtering framework.
